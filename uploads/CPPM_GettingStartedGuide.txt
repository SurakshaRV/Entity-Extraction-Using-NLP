ClearPass Access Management System Overview
The Aruba ClearPass Access Management System provides a window into your network and covers all your
access security requirements from a single platform. You get complete views of mobile devices and users and
have total control over what they can access.
With ClearPass, IT can centrally manage network policies, automatically configure devices and distribute
security certificates, admit guest users, assess device health, and even share information with third-party
solutions?through a single pane of glass, on any network and without changing the current infrastructure.

Role-Based and Device-Based Access
The ClearPass Policy Manager? platform provides role-based and device-based network access control for
employees, contractors, and guests across any wired, wireless, and VPN infrastructure.
ClearPass works with any multivendor network and can be extended to business and IT systems that are
already in place.

Self-Service Capabilities
ClearPass delivers a wide range of unique self-service capabilities. Users can securely onboard their own
devices for enterprise use or register AirPlay, AirPrint, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), and Universal Plug
and Play (UPnP) devices that are enabled for sharing, sponsor guest Wi-Fi access, and even set up sharing for
Apple TV and Google Chromecast.

Leveraging Contextual Data
The power of ClearPass comes from integrating ultra-scalable AAA (authentication, authorization, and
accounting) with policy management, guest network access, device onboarding, and device health checks with
a complete understanding of context.
From this single ClearPass policy and AAA platform, contextual data is leveraged across the network to ensure
that users and devices are granted the appropriate access privileges.
ClearPass leverages a user?s role, device, location, application use, and time of day to execute custom security
policies, accelerate device deployments, and streamline network operations across wired networks, wireless
networks, and VPNs.

Third-Party Security and IT Systems
ClearPass can be extended to third-party security and IT systems using REST-based APIs to automate work
flows that previously required manual IT intervention. It integrates with mobile device management to
leverage device inventory and posture information, which enables better-informed policy decisions.

Advanced Policy Management
ClearPass advanced policy management support includes:

l

Employee access
ClearPass Policy Manager offers user and device authentication based on 802.1X, non-802.1X, and Web
Portal access methods. To strengthen security in any environment, you can concurrently use multiple
authentication protocols, such as PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-PEAP-Public.
For fine-grained control, you can use attributes from multiple identity stores, such as Microsoft Active
Directory, LDAP-compliant directory, ODBC-compliant SQL database, token servers, and internal databases
across domains within a single policy.
Additionally, you can add posture assessments and remediation to existing policies at any time.

l Built-in device profiling

ClearPass provides a built-in profiling service that discovers and classifies all endpoints, regardless of device
type. You can obtain a variety of contextual data(such as MAC OUIs, DHCP fingerprinting, and other
identity-centric device data) and use this data within policies.
Stored profiling data identifies device profile changes and dynamically modifies authorization privileges.
For example, if a printer appears as a Windows laptop, ClearPass Policy Manager can automatically deny
access.

l Access for unmanaged endpoints

l

Unmanaged non-802.1X devices (such as printers, IP phones, and IP cameras) can be identified as known
or unknown upon connecting to the network. The identity of these devices is based on the presence of
their MAC address in an external or internal database.
Secure configuration of personal devices
ClearPass Onboard fully automates the provisioning of any Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, and
Ubuntu devices via a built-in enrollment workflow.
Valid users are redirected to a template-based interface to configure required SSIDs and 802.1X settings,
and download unique device credentials.

ClearPass 6.7 Getting Started Guide

Additional capabilities include the ability for IT to revoke and delete credentials for lost or stolen devices,
and the ability to configure mobile email settings for Exchange ActiveSync and VPN clients on some device
types.

l Customizable visitor management

ClearPass Guest simplifies work flow processes so that receptionists, employees, and other non-IT staff can
create temporary guest accounts for secure Wi-Fi and wired network access. Self-registration allows guests
to create their credentials.

l Device health checks

ClearPass OnGuard, as well as separate OnGuard persistent or dissolvable agents, performs advanced
endpoint posture assessments. Traditional NAC health-check capabilities ensure compliance and network
safeguards before devices connect.
You can use information about endpoint integrity (such as status of anti-virus, firewall, and peer-to-peer
applications) to enhance authorization policies. Automatic remediation services are also available for non-
compliant devices.

ClearPass Policy Manager Hardware and Virtual Appliances
ClearPass Policy Manager is available as a hardware or a virtual appliance. To increase scalability and
redundancy, you can deploy virtual appliances, as well as the hardware appliances, within a cluster.

UID (Unit ID)

The UID LED helps you identify and locate a system, especially in high-density rack
environments. Additionally, the UID is used to indicate that a critical operation is
underway on the host, such as Remote console access or ROM flash.

The "current state" (on or off) of the UID is the last state chosen using one of these
methods. If a new state is chosen while the UID is blinking, this new state becomes
the current state, and takes effect when the UID stops blinking.
NOTE: The Unit ID Light web page does not automatically refresh itself if the state
of the actual light changes after the page is loaded. To ensure the page accurately
reflects the state of the UID Light, click on the Virtual Indicators link to update the

Introduction
The VMware vSphere® Web Client enables you to connect to a vCenter Server system to manage an ESX host
through a browser.
This section assumes that the VMware vSphere Web Client has been installed. For information about installing
and starting the vSphere Web Client, go to VMware Documentation.

Meeting the Recommended vSphere HypervisorServer Specifications
Please carefully review all virtual appliance requirements, including functional IOP ratings, and verify that your
system meets these requirements. These recommendations supersede earlier requirements that were
published for ClearPass Policy Manager 6.7 installations.
Virtual appliance recommendations are adjusted to align with the requirements for ClearPass hardware
appliances. If you do not have the virtual appliance resources to support a full workload, you should consider
ordering the ClearPass Policy Manager hardware appliance.
Be sure that your system meets the recommended specifications required for the Policy Manager virtual
appliance.

Supplemental Storage/Hard Disk Requirement
All VMware vSphere Hypervisor virtual machines use hardware version 8.
ClearPass VMware ships with a 30 GB hard disk volume. This must be supplemented with additional
storage/hard disk by adding a virtual hard disk (see Adding a Virtual Hard Disk on page 26 for details). The
additional space required depends on the ClearPass virtual appliance version.

Processing and Memory Requirements
To ensure scalability, dedicate or reserve the processing and memory to the ClearPass VM instance. You must
also ensure that the disk subsystem can maintain the IOPs (I/O operations per second) throughput as detailed
below.

ClearPass Server I/O Rate
Most virtualized environments use a shared disk subsystem, assuming that each application will have bursts of
I/O without a sustained high I/O throughput. ClearPass Policy Manager requires a continuous sustained high
data-I/O rate.
For the latest information on the supported hypervisors and virtual hardware requirements, refer to the Release
Notes in the appropriate version folder under Support Center > Documentation > Software User & Reference
Guides > ClearPass > Release Notes.

Supported Hypervisors
ClearPass supports the following hypervisors:

Introduction
Microsoft Hyper-V enables you to create and manage a virtualized computing environment by using
virtualization technology that is built in to Windows Server. Installing Hyper-V installs the required components
and optionally installs management tools.

This section assumes that Microsoft Hyper-V has been installed.

Supported Hypervisors
ClearPass supports the following hypervisors:

Hypervisor

Supported Versions

VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)

l 5.5
l 6.0
l 6.5 U1

Microsoft Hyper-V

l Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V
l Windows Server 2016 with Hyper-V
l Windows Hyper-V Server 2012 R2
l Windows Hyper-V Server 2016

For the latest information about supported hypervisors
and virtual appliance system requirements, look in the
appropriate version folders in the Aruba Support
Center > Documentation > Software User &
Reference Guides > ClearPass > Release Notes.

Meeting the Recommended Hyper-V Server Specifications
Please carefully review all virtual appliance requirements, including functional IOP ratings, and verify that your
system meets these requirements. These recommendations supersede earlier requirements that were
published for ClearPass Policy Manager 6.7 installations.
Virtual appliance recommendations are adjusted to align with the requirements for ClearPass hardware
appliances. If you do not have the virtual appliance resources to support a full workload, you should consider
ordering the ClearPass Policy Manager hardware appliance

Supplemental Storage/Hard Disk Requirements
ClearPassHyper-V ships with a 30 GB hard disk volume. This must be supplemented with additional
storage/hard disk by adding a virtual hard disk (see Adding a Hard Disk to a Virtual Machine on page 43 for
details). The additional space required depends on the ClearPass virtual appliance version.

Processing and Memory Requirements
To ensure scalability, dedicate or reserve the processing and memory to the ClearPass VM instance. You must
also ensure that the disk subsystem can maintain the IOPs (I/O operations per second) throughput as detailed
below.

ClearPass Server I/O Rate
Most virtualized environments use a shared disk subsystem, assuming that each application will have bursts of
I/O without a sustained high I/O throughput. ClearPass Policy Manager requires a continuous sustained high
data I/O rate.

Virtual Appliance Platforms
Aruba provides three virtual appliance platforms, plus an evaluation platform:
l ClearPassPolicy Manager C1000V
l ClearPassPolicy Manager C2000V
l ClearPassPolicy Manager C3000V
l ClearPassPolicy Manager CLABV

Additional Virtual Hard Disk Considerations
Additional considerations to take into account when adding virtual hard disks are as follows:
l By default, membership in the local Administrators group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to
complete this procedure. However, an administrator can use Authorization Manager to modify the

ClearPass 6.7 Getting Started Guide

46

authorization policy so that a user or group of users can complete this procedure.

l Virtual hard disks are stored as .vhd files, which makes them portable, but it also poses a potential security

risk. We recommend that you mitigate this risk by taking precautions such as storing the .vhd files in a
secure location.
The virtual hard disk is created when you click Finish to complete the wizard. Depending on the options
you choose for the virtual hard disk, the process can take a considerable amount of time.

l

l Virtual hard disks cannot be stored in a folder that uses New Technology File System (NTFS) compression.

l

You can make certain changes to a virtual hard disk after you create it. For example, you can convert it
from one type of virtual hard disk to another. You can use the Edit Virtual Hard Disk wizard to make
these changes.

Description

Comments

Displays server identity and connection
parameters. The configurations for the
management port and the data port are also
displayed.

This tab also provides parameters to allow
you to enable Insight and specify the Insight
master, enable OnConnect, and enable
ingress events processing.

You can view the status of a Policy Manager
service (that is, see whether a service is
running or not), and stop or start services.

This option allows you to change the system
parameters for all services.

The options on this page vary based on the
service selected.

This option allows you to configure SNMP
parameters, ensuring that external
MIB browsers can browse the system-level
MIB objects exposed by the Policy Manager
appliance.

Use the Network page to:
l Configure Application Access Control?

allow or deny access to network
resources.

l Add SSH Public Keys
l Create generic routing encapsulation

(GRE) tunnels

l Create IPsec tunnels
l Create VLANs related to guest users.

The options on this page vary based on the
SNMP version that you select.

l A GRE tunnel creates a virtual point-to-

point link between controllers over a
standard IP network or the Internet.

l To create VLANs, your network

infrastructure must support tagged
802.1Q packets on the physical interface
selected.

FIPS

Enables ClearPass to operate in Federal
Information Processing Standard mode.

For most users, this tab should be ignored.
NOTE: Enabling FIPS mode resets the
database.

Subset of CLI for ClearPass Maintenance Tasks
The CLI provides a way to manage and configure Policy Manager information.
You can access the CLI from the console using the serial port on the ClearPass appliance hardware, or remotely
using SSH, or use the VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, or KVM console to run the virtual appliance.
